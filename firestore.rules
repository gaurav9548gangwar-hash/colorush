/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Tiranga color prediction game.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset has been simplified. It no longer requires admin authentication
 * to read data for the admin panel. It primarily enforces user-ownership 
 * for creating and managing their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: User profiles.
 * - `/game_rounds/{gameId}`: Publicly accessible information about game rounds.
 * - `/deposits/{depositId}`: All user deposit requests.
 * - `/withdrawals/{withdrawalId}`: All user withdrawal requests.
 * - `/users/{userId}/bets/{betId}`: Bets placed by a specific user.
