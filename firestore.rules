/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Tiranga color prediction game.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, bets,
 * deposits, and withdrawals. Game rounds are publicly readable. Administrative
 * roles are managed through a dedicated 'admins' collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /game_rounds/{gameRoundId}: Stores game round data, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/bets/{betId}: Stores user bets, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/deposits/{depositId}: Stores deposit requests, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/withdrawals/{withdrawalId}: Stores withdrawal requests, accessible only to the user.
 * - /admins/{adminId}: Stores admin user IDs, used for role-based access control.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private and only accessible to the authenticated user.
 * - Game round data is public.
 * - Listing of bets, deposits, and withdrawals is restricted to the owner (user).
 * - The 'admins' collection is used to grant administrative privileges.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User-owned documents (bets, deposits, withdrawals) are stored under the
 *   /users/{userId} path, making ownership checks simple and efficient.
